# LiFi
LIFI- "LIGHT FIDELITY". It is a progression
for remote correspondence between IoT devices utilizing
light to transmit information. In-specialized term we can
state that ,LIFI is an obvious light correspondence
framework that is equipped for transmitting information at
high speeds over the noticeable light range, bright and
infrared radiation. The idea of lifi is information
correspondence on quick gleaming of light which isn't
distinguished by human eye yet it is centered around
photodetector which changes over the on-off state into
parallel computerized information. This happens in the form
of a binary transmission of data, where ‘0’ is the LED in its
‘off state’ and ‘1’ is the LED in its ‘on-state’.

How LiFi works:

LiFi and WiFi are electromagnetically transmitting
information. Nevertheless, wifi uses radio waves where as
lifi uses light spectrum. LiFi utilizes photodetector to get
light flag, and a pennant preparing fragment to change over
the information into 'Stream-capable' content. An LED light
is a semi-transport light source suggesting that the steady of
intensity gave to a LED light can be changed at high speeds
without being discernible to the human eye. Data is
reinforced into a LED light with banner taking care ofdevelopment, it by then sends data which is embedded in its
bar at quick to the photo detector.
Figure1 explains that from internet resources it will transmit
streaming content to drivers then it goes on lit led lamp.
There will be an on-off state to control, where 0 is for off
and 1 is for on. Using a detector connected in any particular
system can detect the data emitted through an LED lamp
which is then amplified and processed later it passed on to
the system.

Blind Indoor Navigation System:

Indoor navigation is suitable for all and it is particularly
crucial for visually impaired people. LED lights emit visible
light, with location data and the data is received by the built
in system or the phone. The build-in system or phone
calculates the optimal path to a designation and speaks via a
headphone to a visually impaired person. LED lights emit
visible light with location data and using build-in systems
or phones instead of Arduino with a visible light receiver to
receive the data. The LiFi enabled text to speech can be
utilized as an option for the visually impaired. The built - in
system and phone calculates the best possible way to a
designation and speaks with a headphone to the visually
impaired. The signal from the nearest LED would be
detected by a receiver in the headset and play the relevant
message that shown in Figure 8. In Figure 7 The
implementation has been done to show the working of
blind indoor navigation system.

CONCLUSION

This project is based on LiFi technology and its application. In
the first section audio transmission using Lifi is implemented
and that explain working audio transmission. It is shown that
audio transmission can be achieved with a distance up to 30cm
and improvements can be made by adding a focusing lens
between the transmitter and the receiver. Second phase deals
this text transmission. For this Arduino Uno to transmit data
using an LED. In the data transmission prototype, the code
has give to Arduino to transmit character or number. On the
third phase Lifi is implemented based on application that
can solve the real world problems of visually impaired
peoples.
